Thanks to the [pointer by kyrias](https://gist.github.com/expipiplus1/e571ce88c608a1e83547c918591b149f#gistcomment-2666077), I managed to make nix work in ArchLinux with:

```
sudo pacman -S rsync
bash <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
# After finishing the installer there's this message:
# Before Nix will work in your existing shells, you'll need to close
# them and open them again. Other than that, you should be ready to go.

# Try it! Open a new terminal, and type:

#  $ nix-shell -p nix-info --run "nix-info -m"

# But the nix commands were not added to my PATH, did a:
source /etc/profile.d/nix.sh
# and all working good now, added that to my .bashrc as well
```

> On Linux and macOS, the easiest way to install Nix is to run the following shell command (as a user other than root):

> This script will download a distribution-independent binary tarball containing Nix and its dependencies, and unpack it in /nix.

> I had the same problem. I think it has something to do with archlinux not having kernel user namespaces enabled. Doing

> I think it might work without `nprivileged_userns_clone` if you disable sandboxing in `nix.conf`, but I wouldn't recommend that, as some packages tend to e.g. discover `/usr/lib/*` and use them.

> I think it is also important to note that the unprivileged_userns_clone flag is a Debian invention that was not upstreamed and will not exist on all systems, see for example this article on lwn.net.
> On CentOS 6 for example I had to change a different flag:
> ```
> echo 10000 > /proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces
> ```
