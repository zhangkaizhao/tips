== How to refer to link? #2581
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/2581

- Use attributes in Asciidoctor:

 I search using {link-ecosia}.

Result:

I search using {link-ecosia}.

- Numbers can be used as attributes too in Asciidoctor:

 You can't go wrong with {1}.

Result:

You can't go wrong with {1}.

- More examples from references:

1.

 Check out {url-home}[Asciidoctor]!

Result:

Check out {url-home}[Asciidoctor]!

2.

 {checkedbox} That's done!

Result:

{checkedbox} That's done!

== No whitespace between text and link #815
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.org/issues/815

- Use attribute in Asciidoctor is better but not working now:

 ASN.1{link-asn1}

Result:

ASN.1{link-asn1}

- Working when no whitespace:

 {link-asn1}

Result:

{link-asn1}

- Working solution using `link:`:

 ASN.1link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One[^↝^]

Result:

ASN.1link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One[^↝^]

which is not so good.

And we can make it as a attribute:

 ASN.1{ASN1-link}

Result:

ASN.1{ASN1-link}

Works!
