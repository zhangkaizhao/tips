# Adding port forwarding on a Vagrant box

https://stackoverflow.com/a/52348660/3449199

Another way to set up a temporary terminal, besides opening up the VirtualBox settings,
is to use `vagrant ssh`, with additional arguments given after the `--`:

    vagrant ssh -- -L 3000:localhost:3000

This will forward port 3000 on the host to port 3000 on the guest.

The first number is for the host. To forward port 7001 on the host to the default postgresql port on the guest:

    vagrant ssh -- -L 7001:localhost:5432

This will only last as long as your ssh session. If ssh gets disconnected, run it again.
To make it persist after restarts, add it to your `Vagrantfile`.
