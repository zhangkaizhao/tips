Vorpar:
When talking about what something is, they can both be used the same way.

The difference is their additional definitions:

A property can mean land or a house.

Attributing something means to give credit to someone (usually a writer).

Mr Wordy:
Also, "properties" tends not to be used to describe the characteristics of a person: "He has the right attributes for the job", not "He has the right properties for the job".

For purely physical (non-human) characteristics, I'd tend to use "properties" (though "attributes" in this sense is not wrong): "This alloy has many useful properties".
