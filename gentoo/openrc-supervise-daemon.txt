Supervise-daemon is OpenRC's daemon supervisor. It can start, stop and restart system processes when they terminate unexpectedly.

## Introduction

OpenRC traditionally uses **start-stop-daemon**, often abbreviated to **s-s-d** for starting and stopping programs. When s-s-d starts a process it saves the process' PID somewhere on permanent storage (typically under /run/), and backgrounds (daemonizes) the process it started. When the time comes to stop, kill, or signal the daemon process s-s-d will use the saved PID file to find the right process.

Supervising on the other hand usually keeps the started daemon as a child process of the supervisor. Backgrounding the daemon is therefore not needed, and not desired. Pidfiles are not needed because the supervisor process remembers the pid.

Supervising daemon process has a few major advantages:

1. If and when a daemon process dies (crashes) then its supervisor will notice it and try to restart it.
2. Any terminal output sent by the daemon process to stdout and stderr can be caught by the supervisor, and then sent to the system logger or to a file.

This article aims to provide help how to bring services under its supervision.

## General recipe

Currently, standard Gentoo init files do not use process supervision with supervise-daemon yet: it is left to users to make these modifications to the init files.

The general recipe to bring a service under the control of supervise-daemon is to adapt its init file in /etc/init.d as follows:

* always add `supervisor="supervise-daemon"`
* remove any pidfile reference that the command would create. supervise-daemon needs a pidfile for itself. e.g. :

  * change `command_args="-p ${pidfile} ${NTPD_OPTS}"` into `command_args="${NTPD_OPTS}" command_args_background="-p ${pidfile}"`

* make sure the daemon will run in foreground by applying one of the following methods:

  * if the daemon forks itself to the background (daemonizes itself) then pass the appropriate daemon command line option, e.g. `command_args_foreground="--foreground"`. Note that the command line option to prevent daemonizing is different per service, and some services might not even provide this option.
  * if there is a command line parameter for the daemon process to make it daemonize itself, then move it to `command_args_background`

* replace calls to `start-stop-daemonand` if needed with calls to `${supervisor}` as appropriate.
