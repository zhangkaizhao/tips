workaround 1:

Set `SDKROOT` environment variable to `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk` to let clang find std header files e.g. `stdio.h`, and then use `clang` command line with `-L/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib` to let clang find std libraries.

workaround 2:

Use `clang` command line with `-isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk` and `-L /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib` to have the same effect.

NOTE: The SDK path can be found via `$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)`.
