# Use xattr on the App Throwing the Damaged Error

https://osxdaily.com/2019/02/13/fix-app-damaged-cant-be-opened-trash-error-mac/

With the command line you can use xattr to view and remove extended attributes from a file on the Mac including the application throwing the “Appname.app is damaged and can’t be opened. You should move it to the Trash.” error message.

Launch Terminal and then issue the following command:

    xattr -cr /path/to/application.app

For example:

    xattr -cr /Applications/Signal.app

The -c flag removes all attributes, whereas -r applies recursively for the entire targeted .app directory contents.

A real example:

The Zulu JDK 17 file downloaded from https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu17.34.19-ca-jdk17.0.3-macosx_x64.tar.gz
(via https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&os=macos&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk )
has this issue.

    tar xf zulu17.34.19-ca-jdk17.0.3-macosx_x64.tar.gz
    sudo cp -r zulu17.34.19-ca-jdk17.0.3-macosx_x64/zulu-17.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/
    /usr/libexec/java_home -V

Now, run the xattr command as follow to get rid of "zulu-17.jdk is damaged..." error when calling `java` or `javac` from the installed Zulu JDK:

    xattr -cr /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk

Another real example:

The Sublime Merge zip file `sublime_merge_build_2071_mac.zip` downloaded from https://www.sublimemerge.com/download
has this issue.

    unzip sublime_merge_build_2071_mac.zip
    mv Sublime\ Merge.app /Applications/

Now, run the xattr command as follow to get rid of "Sublime Merge.app is damaged..." error when trying to launch it::

    xattr -cr /Applications/Sublime\ Merge.app
