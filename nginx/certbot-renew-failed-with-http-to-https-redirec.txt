# Renewal failed with HTTP to HTTTPS redirection #3361

https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/3361#issuecomment-278799548

Workaround by https://github.com/mehov :

```
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    # relevant https configuration
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        return 301 http://$server_name$request_uri;
    }
}
server {
    listen 80;
    # relevant http configuration
    location / {
        return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
    }
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {}
}
```

> Not obvious: the order of the sever directives is important.
