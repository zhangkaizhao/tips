> Note however that Nim is both case- and underscore-insensitive meaning that helloWorld and hello_world would be the same name. The exception to this is the first character, which is case-sensitive. Names can also include both numbers and other UTF-8 characters, even emojis should you wish that, but keep in mind you and possibly others will have to type them.

I do think this is weird.
