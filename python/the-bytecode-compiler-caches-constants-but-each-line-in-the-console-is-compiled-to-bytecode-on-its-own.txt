On PyPy the result is also True. 'is' done by value for ints.

Side note, even on cpython the 2nd result is True, if you put the code into a file, not the shell.
Why? Because the bytecode compiler caches constants, but each line in the console is compiled to bytecode on its own.

Itâ€™s interesting to know why this happens, but consider it a novelty of the Python implementation.
Never rely on this kind of behaviour.

Guess the result.

    >>> a = 256
    >>> b = 256
    >>> print(a is b)
    True

    >>> a = 300
    >>> b = 300
    >>> print(a is b)
    # Result?
