# Test-only dependencies

Use `dev-dependencies`. From the [Cargo docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#development-dependencies):

> You can add a `[dev-dependencies]` section to your `Cargo.toml` whose format is equivalent to `[dependencies]`:
>
> ```
> [dev-dependencies]
> tempdir = "0.3"
> ```
>
> Dev-dependencies are not used when compiling a package for building, but are used for compiling tests, examples, and benchmarks.
