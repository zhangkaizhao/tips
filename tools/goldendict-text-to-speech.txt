Question
========

**How can I add text-to-speech to GoldenDict?**

How can I add a text to speech service or any other similar services to GoldenDict for offline use?

I am using Ubuntu 13.10 and I want to learn how to pronounce English words I don't know.

Answer

You can use the Programs tab to plug a text to speech software (`espeak <http://espeak.sourceforge.net/>` for example) into the golden dic.

Here are the steps:

1. Install espeak:

    sudo apt-get install espeak

2. Open GoldenDic and hit F3 to bring up the **Dictionaries** window (or select *Edit/Dictionaries* menu).

3. On the **Sources** tab, select **Programs** tab.

4. Click the **Add** button, select **Audio** for the *Type* column, enter **espeak** for the *Name*, and `espeak -v en %GDWORD%` for the *Command Line* column.

5. Don't forget to check the *Enabled* box.

6. Click OK

7. Close the GoldenDic window and reopen it.

Now you have an item named **espeak** in your dictionaries and your translation results. Clicking the speaker icon in front of the word in **espeak** result, reads the word for you.
