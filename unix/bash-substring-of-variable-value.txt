# Substring of variable value in Bash

via https://stackoverflow.com/a/14992694/3449199

If the variable is: `FOO="qwertzuiopasdfghjklyxcvbnm"`

then

```bash
echo ${FOO:0:10}
```

will give the first 10 characters.

If x is constant, the following parameter expansion performs substring extraction:

```bash
b=${a:12:5}
```

where 12 is the offset (zero-based) and 5 is the length

If the underscores around the digits are the only ones in the input,
you can strip off the prefix and suffix (respectively) in two steps:

```bash
tmp=${a#*_}   # remove prefix ending in "_"
b=${tmp%_*}   # remove suffix starting with "_"
```

If there are other underscores, it's probably feasible anyway, albeit more tricky.
If anyone knows how to perform both expansions in a single expression, I'd like to know too.

Both solutions presented are pure bash, with no process spawning involved, hence very fast.
