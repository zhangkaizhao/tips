# extract .deb files

via https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-extract-a-deb-file-without-opening-it-on-debian-or-ubuntu-linux/

A Debian or Ubuntu .deb package is nothing but old good Unix ar archive format.
The ar command is used to keep together groups of files as a single archive and .deb includes the following three files:

* debian-binary – A text file indicating the version of the .deb package format.
* control.tar.gz – A compressed file and it contains md5sums and control directory for building package.
* data.tar.xz – A compressed file and it contains all the files to be installed on your system.

The syntax is:

    ar x {file.deb}
