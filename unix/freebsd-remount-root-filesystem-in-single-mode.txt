# Remount read-only root filesystem to read-write in single mode in FreeBSD

After system crashed, a `fsck` may be needed. (The root filesystem may be marked not unmount properly.)

Boot in the single mode, by default the root filesystem is mounted as read-only.

Run the `fsck` utility with `-y` option to fix errors:

```
fsck -y /dev/ada0p6
```

The `-y` option indicates:

```
     -y      Causes fsck to assume yes as the answer to all operator
             questions.
```

via `main 8 fsck` in FreeBSD 11.2-RC2.

After the `fsck` process finished, the root filesystem is marked as clean.

And we can remount the root filesystem from read-only to read-write.

Run the `mount` utility with `-u` option to remount it as read-write:

```
mount -u -o rw /
```

The `-u` option indicates:


```
     -u      The -u flag indicates that the status of an already mounted file
             system should be changed.  Any of the options discussed above
             (the -o option) may be changed; also a file system can be changed
             from read-only to read-write or vice versa.  An attempt to change
             from read-write to read-only will fail if any files on the file
             system are currently open for writing unless the -f flag is also
             specified.  The set of options is determined by applying the
             options specified in the argument to -o and finally applying the
             -r or -w option.
```

via `man 8 mount` in FreeBSD 11.2-RC2.

No files or directories in the root filesystem can be modified when the root filesystem is read-only.

And remout it to read-write rescues your poor FreeBSD operating system. :-)
