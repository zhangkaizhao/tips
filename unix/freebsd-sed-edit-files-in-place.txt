# Using sed to edit files in place in FreeBSD

The behavior of `sed` utility in FreeBSD is not all the same as in most of the GNU/Linux distributions.

For example:

```
     Replace all occurances of ‘foo’ with ‘bar’ in the file test.txt, without
     creating a backup of the file:

           sed -i '' -e 's/foo/bar/g' test.txt
```

via `man 1 sed` in FreeBSD(11.2-RC2).

In most of the GNU/Linux distributions, the simple way is:

```
sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' test.txt
```
