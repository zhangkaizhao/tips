# How to disable color output of ls

----

Color output for ls is typically enabled through an alias in most distros nowadays.

```
$ alias ls
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
```

You can always disable an alias temporarily by prefixing it with a backslash.

```
$ \ls
```

Doing the above will short circuit the alias just for this one invocation.
You can use it any time you want to disable any alias.
