Non root processes bind priviledged ports

If your system supports it you could maybe use capabilities. See man capabilities, the one you need would be CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE.

On newer Debian/Ubuntu you can run:

sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin
sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /path/to/program

Okay, thanks to the people who pointed out the capabilities system and CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability. If you have a recent kernel, it is indeed possible to use this to start a service as non-root but bind low ports. The short answer is that you do:

setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /path/to/program
And then anytime program is executed thereafter it will have the CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability. setcap is in the debian package libcap2-bin.

Now for the caveats:

You will need at least a 2.6.24 kernel
This won't work if your file is a script. (ie, uses a #! line to launch an interpreter). In this case, as far I as understand, you'd have to apply the capability to the interpreter executable itself, which of course is a security nightmare, since any program using that interpreter will have the capability. I wasn't able to find any clean, easy way to work around this problem.
Linux will disable LD_LIBRARY_PATH on any program that has elevated privileges like setcap or suid. So if your program uses its own .../lib/, you might have to look into another option like port forwarding.
Resources:

capabilities(7) man page. Read this long and hard if you're going to use capabilities in a production environment. There are some really tricky details of how capabilities are inherited across exec() calls that are detailed here.
setcap man page
"Bind ports below 1024 without root on GNU/Linux": The document that first pointed me towards setcap.
Note: RHEL first added this in v6.

How to allow non root access to bind below port number 1024?

But there are two method by which we can assign port number less than 1024 without having root privilege :

1. Method 1 : Using CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE to grant low-numbered port access to a process :
For this, we just need to run following command in terminal :

  sudo setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip /path/to/binary

2. Method 2 : Using authbind to grant one-time access, with finer user/group/port control. Let we have to assign port number 80. For this, following steps required :

* Install authbind using any package manager
* Run following two commands one by one in terminal :

  sudo touch /etc/authbind/byport/80
  sudo chmod 777 /etc/authbind/byport/80

Here, 80 is given in end of command as we are attempting to assign port number 80.

* Now execute following command in terminal

  authbind --deep /path/to/binary command line args
