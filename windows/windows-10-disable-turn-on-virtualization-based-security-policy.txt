Windows 10 disable "Turn on Virtualization Based Security" policy

2019-06-27

VirtualBox is failed to start virtual machines with error "VT-x is not available".

Run "gpedit.msc" and follow the steps:

Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Device Guard > Turn on Virtualization Based Security to Disabled

Then restart the computer. Now VirtualBox works again.
